This is our project about road segmentation, here are the several instructions you need to follow to be able to run the program run.py :

1. first install the different libraries: 

	- numpy
	- scikit-learn
	- scikit-image
	- tensorflow
	- keras
                                       
2. Then, simply run: python run.py

3. It will output a submission.csv file in the Datasets folder, which contains our predictions on the testing images.


The Datasets folder contains two subfolders test_set_images and training respectively containing the images to run predictions on
and the images to train the model.

As a side note, if you want to change the model and use KNN instead of the neural network, just uncomment in run.py the line 75 (model = knn(X,Y,seed))
and comment the line 76 (model = neural_net(X, Y)). However, note that the KNN gave us worse results.

Finally you can also find a jupyter notebook "classification.ipynb" containing more details, metrics computation and images results.
