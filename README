This our project about road segmentation, here are the several instructions you need to be able to run the program:

1. first install the different libraries: -numpy
                                       -scikit-Learn
                                       -scikit-Image
                                       -tensorflow
                                       -keras
                                       
2. then just run: python run.py

3.it will output a submission.csv in the Datasets folder.


The Datasets folder contains two subfolders test_set_images and training respectively containing the images to run predictions on
and the images to train the system on.

As a special note if you want to change for a KNN instead of the neural network we use, just uncomment in run.py the line 75 (model = knn(X,Y,seed))
and comment the line 76 (model = neural_net(X, Y)), but the KNN gives less good results.
